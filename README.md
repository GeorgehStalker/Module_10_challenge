Precipitation Analysis Summary
This report provides an overview of precipitation patterns in Honolulu, Hawaii, based on data collected over the past year. We have analyzed 18,103 precipitation records to understand rainfall trends.

The average precipitation for this period is 0.16 inches, which indicates that, on average, the amount of rain is relatively light. However, there is considerable variation, as shown by a standard deviation of 0.47 inches, meaning some days have much more rain than others. The lowest recorded precipitation is 0.00 inches, reflecting many days with no rainfall at all. The highest amount recorded was a substantial 11.53 inches, though such extreme values are rare.

Most days see minimal rainfall. Specifically, 25% of the days have no rain at all, and the median precipitation is just 0.01 inches. This median value means that half of the days recorded very light rain. On the other hand, the top 25% of days had more significant rainfall, with 75% of days recording less than 0.11 inches.

In summary, Honolulu experiences mostly dry days with light rain when it does occur. Extreme rainfall events are infrequent but notable. For planning a holiday, expect generally light rain and prepare for occasional heavier showers.
